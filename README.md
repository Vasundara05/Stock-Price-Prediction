# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various machine learning models for stock price prediction. 
Currently, the models are demonstrated using Google stock data, but they can be easily adapted to predict the stock prices of any company by changing the ticker name.

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression: A basic model to predict stock prices based on historical data.
- Other Models: Additional models and techniques will be added.

## Flexibility
The models provided in this repository are designed to be easily adaptable. You can replace the ticker symbol used in the code to predict the stock prices of any other company. 

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for predicting continuous values based on the relationship between input features and the target variable.

## Contents
- Data Collection: Collecting data using yfinance
- Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the data for training.
- Model Training: Training a Linear Regression model on the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Results: Visualizations and results from the model's predictions.


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
